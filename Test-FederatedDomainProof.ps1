.SYNOPSIS
Test-FederatedDomainProof.ps1 - Test the federated domain proof TXT record exists in DNS.
.DESCRIPTION 
This PowerShell script checks DNS for the TXT record containing the federated domain
proof string that must be created when setting up a Hybrid Exchange/Office 365 configuration.
The script must be run from within the Exchange organization that you are testing. In other
words, you can't test Org A's federated domain proof record from Org B.
.OUTPUTS
Results are output to the console.
.PARAMETER Domain
The domain name to check.
.EXAMPLE
.\Test-FederatedDomainProof.ps1 -Domain exchangeserverpro.net
